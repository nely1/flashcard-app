# Ankishiro

Project Description

Ankishiro is a desktop flashcard application that aims to provide Japanese learners a convenient and easy to use method to practice their vocabulary. The user can add as many words into their personal library as they want and can test themselves extensively with a maximum of 200 questions per test. Users may change the amount of questions they get in a test. 

This application is written in python using the Tkinter library to implement widgets due to being a beginner friendly framework with an abundance of support. The vocabulary added is saved into an excel spreadsheet and thus uses OpenPyXL to edit the spreadsheet. 

Challenges faced in this project include the difficulty to extend or add features that can provide for a pleasant user experience. For flexibility, it would be ideal to implement the application as a web application. As a resulf of implementing a web application, UI design will be more appealing, Vocabulary will be saved easily across multiple devices of a user, and a user will be able to edit the application settings as they like.
